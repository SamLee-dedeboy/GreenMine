    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "Hi! Thanks for having me. Well, I've always been fascinated by flying, ever since I was a kid. I studied engineering and aviation, and luckily landed a job flying cargo airships when I was around twenty. It’s been a wild ride ever since!"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewer",
        "content": "That’s impressive! And it must be quite a unique experience working in Zaun’s industrial environment. What’s your day-to-day like as a cargo pilot?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "Oh, it’s unpredictable to say the least. I spend most days navigating through the dense smog, which can be quite challenging. Sometimes I joke that I’m flying blind. I also have to monitor the air quality constantly, as it impacts not just my health but also the safety of my cargo."
    },

        "speaker": "interviewer",
        "content": "That sounds intense. Given the pollution levels in Zaun, can you share some of the health impacts you’ve experienced because of your job?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "Definitely. I’ve developed some respiratory issues over the years. When I first started, I didn’t think much of it, but the more I fly through the smog, the more I notice it. Coughing and shortness of breath have become part of my life, which is frustrating."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewer",
        "content": "I can only imagine how difficult that must be. Have you noticed any changes in your coworkers or the communities you're involved with?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "Yes, many of my colleagues have similar problems. Some have had to quit flying altogether, which is heartbreaking. It also feels like everyone in the community is affected, especially children and the elderly, who have no real defense against the pollution."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewer",
        "content": "It’s disheartening to hear. As someone who sees Zaun from above, do you have a perspective on how the city’s industrial practices contribute to these problems?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "Absolutely. From the air, the smog looks like a constant gray blanket over the city. It’s clear the emissions from factories are out of control. Plus, I often see waste being dumped into the waterways, which is just devastating."
    },

        "speaker": "interviewer",

        "speaker": "interviewer",
        "content": "That’s the spirit! Maintaining pressure is crucial. If there were one change you could implement right away, what would it be?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "I’d ban the worst polluters immediately. Holding these companies accountable is key. They need to know that we’re serious about this and that the health of our community is on the line."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewer",
        "content": "That’s a bold approach! Do you think there’s public support for such measures?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "interviewee",
        "content": "I believe there is. Many people are weary of the smog. If we can mobilize that discontent into action, we could really make a difference."
