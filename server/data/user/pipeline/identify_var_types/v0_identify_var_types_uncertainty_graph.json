I’ve connected with artists who focus on themes around sustainability. We even have a collective that meets regularly to share ideas and plan collaborative projects.\nYes, there’s a mural project we did that illustrates the effects of pollution on local wildlife. It placed a spotlight on biodiversity in Zaun. The response was overwhelming, with many residents getting involved and spreading the word.\nThe evidence indicates the concept of 'response' as the interviewee discusses the community's ability to drive change and the involvement of artists in addressing environmental issues. The mention of a mural project that illustrates the effects of pollution and the overwhelming response from residents further highlights actions taken to protect the environment and raise awareness.",
