I learned a lot from my grandmother, who was an apothecary before all this industrial growth took over. She instilled in me the importance of herbal remedies and care, especially for those who can’t afford traditional medicine."

The heavy pollution and the loss of natural spaces mean we’re sacrificing our health and well-being. There's a disconnect from the natural world that my grandmother cherished, and it pains me to watch that."
